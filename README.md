## Project Description

The **Music Events Web Scraper** is a web scraping program engineered to extract detailed information about music events from [**Eventbrite**](http://eventbrite.com.au), a popular event management and ticketing platform. Users can specify a country and a city to gather attribute data on upcoming music events, including event names, venues, addresses, dates and times, durations, prices, booking statuses, and web URLs. The collected data is subsequently saved in a CSV file, which is then attached to a marketing email sent to designated recipients. Additionally, the data is transferred to a local PostgreSQL database for efficient storage and management.

<br>

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Efficiently extracts detailed attributes of music events such as names, venues, addresses, dates and times, durations, prices, booking statuses, and URLs.
- **CSV Export**: Saves the scraped data into a CSV file for easy access and analysis.
- **Email Notification**: Sends a marketing email with the attached CSV file to specified recipient(s).
- **Database Storage**: Transfers the collected data to a local PostgreSQL database for structured storage and retrieval.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
MusicEventsWebScraper/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ email-html-body-template.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ "sample outputs"/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸŽ¶ Unmissable Music Events Coming Up in Sydney, Australia! ðŸŒŸ.eml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ music-events-sydney-australia-20240609220753.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                 
â””â”€â”€ LICENSE 
```

- **main.py**: This file is the core script containing the Python code responsible for scraping music events data, emailing the CSV output, and handling database operations.
- **email-html-body-template.txt**: The file serves as a template for the body of the output marketing email. It contains HTML markup along with placeholders (typically formatted as %s) that allow for dynamic insertion of specific content, such as the city name, at runtime.
- **sample outputs/**: This directory houses example outputs from the scraper, including an output CSV file and a marketing email, showcasing the functionality of the program.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the required Python modules and packages necessary to run the desktop app. You can install these dependencies on your local computer by running the commandÂ `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **.gitignore**: Prevents specific files and directories from being tracked by Git, maintaining the cleanliness of the repository by excluding temporary files and sensitive information.
- **README.md**: Provides a detailed overview of the repository, including descriptions of its functionality, usage instructions, and information on how to contribute.
- **LICENSE**: The license file for the project.
