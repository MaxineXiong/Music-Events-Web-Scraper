## Project Description

The **Music Events Web Scraper** is a web scraping program engineered to extract detailed information about music events from the [**Eventbrite**](http://eventbrite.com.au), a popular event management and ticketing platform. Users can specify a country and a city to gather attribute data on upcoming music events, including event names, venues, addresses, dates and times, durations, prices, booking statuses, and web URLs. The collected data is subsequently saved in a CSV file, which is then attached to a marketing email sent to designated recipients. Additionally, the data is transferred to a local PostgreSQL database for efficient storage and management.

<br>

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Efficiently extracts detailed attributes of music events such as names, venues, addresses, dates and times, durations, prices, booking statuses, and URLs.
- **CSV Export**: Saves the scraped data into a CSV file for easy access and analysis.
- **Email Notification**: Sends a marketing email with the attached CSV file to specified recipient(s).
- **Database Storage**: Transfers the collected data to a local PostgreSQL database for structured storage and retrieval.
